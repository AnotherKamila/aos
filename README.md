This is the repository that contains the handouts for the
[AOS course](http://www.systems.ethz.ch/courses/fall2016/aos).

Those handouts include
 * Lecture slides
 * Project milestone descriptions
 * Project milestone code handouts


Each week's materials will be put into this repository in a branch named weekN
where N is the number of the week. 

See the relevant milestone description (branch weekN, handouts/milestoneX.pdf)
